Hello, I'm Logan Parker. I'm a machine learning engineer who loves building machine learning infrastructure and tools 👷🏼‍♂️.  I currently work at CoreLogic primarily focusing on Computer Vision (CV) and 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, I have experience (2+ years) as a software engineer [across various industries](https://www.linkedin.com/in/logansparker/).
:::

I'm currently exploring entrepreneurship at the intersection of dev tools, ML platforms and large language models. I am working on some projects right now including a proper solution to pesky bill splitting.

## 💼 Get In Touch

Do you need help operationalizing ML or large language models or maybe want to chat about VR research?
