    "text": "Opportunities\nWhile conducting product research, I interviewed many developers from different backgrounds to understand their pain points and needs. All developers I talked to struggled with one key challenge: it was difficult, if not impossible, to convince other engineers to use nbdev.\nThe following are the biggest reasons that prevented adoption:\n\nFriction in onboarding engineers. In many companies, there are often existing Python projects, and it can be detrimental to maintain different ways of doing things when a company has already settled upon one way that it has built processes and tools around.\nCollisions with the rest of the software development stack: it was (and still is) a pain to version control notebooks in a way that’s conducive to collaboration. For practical purposes, you cannot perform code reviews of notebooks on GitHub without purchasing a tool called ReviewNB. So instead of convincing people to use nbdev, you have to convince them to use nbdev and ReviewNB. This makes the barrier to initial adoption considerably high - as procuring software in many organizations is a non-trivial process involving security review, compliance, legal and other stakeholders.\n\nI viewed solving the above problems as potential opportunities for commercializing nbdev."

    "section": "Shifting Focus",
    "text": "Shifting Focus\nJeremy, Wasim, and I eventually settled on the idea of “WordPress for developers,” a hosted site allowing people to create and share nbdev projects. We thought this would be an excellent way to get people to try nbdev without installing anything. The idea was to narrow the audience to people interested in hosting projects on a platform that promoted exploration and sharing, similar to Glitch that was as easy to use and pragmatic as Wordpress.\nAround the same time we began discussing hosted tools, the machine learning world experienced a tectonic shift due to the explosion of Generative AI, namely Stable Diffusion. fast.ai, the organization that created nbdev, was also changing its focus. fast.ai’s prime directive was to make deep learning accessible to as many people as possible, and generative AI was too important to ignore. Accordingly, Jeremy placed his full attention on a Stable Diffusion course.\nThis pivot caused some turbulence as we navigated the different priorities of nbdev, generative AI research, and making money. We eventually settled on offering consulting services for everything related to fast.ai in the form of fast.ai partners, which would allow us to bootstrap ourselves financially and embrace the larger mission of fast.ai (including generative AI and research). Eventually, I found the splintered focus across so many areas to be unproductive1 and decided to step away from everything except consulting to regain my footing.\nSoon after that, ChatGPT emerged onto the scene and caused further shifts in machine learning that were orders of magnitude larger than their text-to-image predecessors. Pretty soon, all of my clients were interested in language models, and I found myself working exclusively on operationalizing them (a skill that I have cultivated by working in machine learning for 20+ years). Additionally, LLMs profoundly changed the nature of software development, especially the kind of software development that nbdev was designed to support2. These factors and those discussed earlier suggested it was a good time to step away from nbdev and focus on other things."

I always struggled to gain conviction that there was a good business model for nbdev.3 Instead, I pursued this path because I was drawn to the idea of starting a business with people I really liked. Ultimately, I learned that at least one person needs strong conviction in addition to being excited about the people you are working with - not just one or the other.4 I also learned that it’s important to be honest with yourself about your (and your team’s) level of conviction and not try to force something that isn’t there.\nListen to your instincts. I ignored my instincts on multiple occasions throughout this journey. As I’ve grown older, I’ve learned to make this mistake much less often, but I could have done better here.\nDon’t be afraid to pivot. I think we avoided unnecessary churn by steering clear of a situation that wasn’t promising. I’m much more excited about the work I’m doing now.5\nOwn your own brand. My professional brand became increasingly tied to fast.ai and my friend Jeremy Howard. I’m grateful for the growth I’ve experienced under this mentorship – but I believe it is important to build your own distinct brand and identity. I discovered it can be challenging to build your own brand when you are working on someone else’s project6, and is something I struggled with. I’m looking forward to working on this more."

    "text": "K8s For Data Scientists Course\n\n\n\nIf you came here looking for the course, feel free to jump ahead to: K8s For Data Scientists.\nKubernetes, known as K8s, is an open-source system for deploying and managing containerized applications in the cloud. An increasing amount of modern web applications are deployed on K8s. If you are an ML engineer, it is increasingly likely that either the infrastructure you use to train, monitor, or orchestrate your models is deployed on K8s, or downstream applications that consume your models are running on K8s. However, K8s is a complex system that can be intimidating to learn.\nI agree with Chip Huyen that, in theory, Data Scientists shouldn’t need to learn K8s. However, the truth is: Even though you shouldn’t have to, it’s really beneficial if you do! I’ve found that I’m often constrained by infrastructure and that infrastructure is increasingly hosted on Kubernetes.\nFor example, I’m rarely given access to a cloud provider’s console, and instead, I have access to a K8s cluster with some data tools already installed. When something goes awry, it’s beneficial to know enough about K8s to debug the issue. Additionally, familiarity with basic concepts allows me to have more productive conversations with my team about infrastructure.\nVicki Boykis seems to agree that the investment in learning this technology is worthwhile1:\nBelow, I outline several reasons why learning K8s is a good idea for machine learning engineers2."

For example, I’ve seen the following tools deployed alongside or in place of hosted solutions:\n\nMetaflow\nKubeflow\nArgo\nJupyterHub\nDask\netc.\n\nWhen open source isn’t enough, third-party vendors are happy to install their software on your cloud. However, you often need basic infrastructure skills to enable this. These skills often intersect with Kubernetes. While you may not be responsible for deploying the infrastructure yourself, it is helpful to understand the basics of how things work so that you can do basic debugging and troubleshooting. For example, knowing where to find logs or an API/HTTPS endpoint can unblock you in many cases."

    "text": "Nobody is coming to save you\n\n\n\nA super hero\n\n\nA typical first experience as a machine learning professional is that you don’t have the necessary tools to get started. This is incredibly frustrating, as making progress without the proper tools can be hard. This experience usually culminates in a conversation like this:\n\nML Eng: I’m excited to join ACME company! You’ve hired me to optimize marketing spending with predictive models. The issue is that we don’t have the basic infrastructure or tools necessary for me to work efficiently.\nManager: I’m confused. Can’t you install the tools you need? Isn’t that what you are for? I was expecting that you would figure it out.\nML Eng: No, I don’t know how to set up and deploy infrastructure. We need a special infrastructure or DevOps person for that.\nManager: It will be hard to ask for more resources if we don’t know the expected return on investment. Can you do the ML project first, demonstrate some value, and then we can invest in infrastructure?\nML Eng: I need some minimum tools to experiment more quickly and develop a proof of concept. Also, I need tools that might help me collaborate better with my team…\n\nMy experience is that DevOps teams are chronically understaffed and overworked. While it usually isn’t advisable to deploy enterprise software yourself on Kubernetes for security concerns, having basic skills can lift a tremendous burden off your DevOps counterparts and make it tractable for them to help you.\nK8s are not a panacea for all infrastructure problems. You must operate within the constraints of your organization and existing software stack.4 However, with its growing popularity, it is increasingly likely that learning this technology will help you."

For example, hosting your data product on a single VM is often insufficient if you want to deploy production software. Many companies even have infrastructure that may block you from doing this with paved paths that only include Kubernetes.\nEven if you are not deploying any production software, K8s can be invaluable in allowing you to deploy the tools you need.

When she says you should learn K8s, you should pay attention!↩︎\nEach subsection of this article has a picture that has been generated by Stable diffusion with a prompt that very similar to the image caption.↩︎\nThese systems are AWS - Sagemaker, Azure - AzureML and GCP - VertexAI.↩︎\nSome organizations have built solutions that avoid K8s. For example, BigHat uses a solution based on AWS SageMaker + Lambda and other hosted solutions. So it might be a mistake to try to move over to K8s in that example – you should try to leverage your company’s existing tech stack where possible!↩︎\nMy friend Michał Jastrzębski, who specializes in ML infrastructure, has shared the following colorful anecdote with me: “when I hear Data Scientists shouldn’t learn K8s”, I hear “DevOps needs to learn Airflow”.↩︎\nSpecifically, K8s concepts that are relevant are namespaces, labels and RBAC.↩︎"

    "text": "Solution\nYou can use conda to manage your CUDA versions! This allows you to isolate specific CUDA versions to specific environments rather than managing CUDA versions globally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI’m using mamba which has faster solvers than conda. Refer to the docs for installation instructions.\n\n\nLet’s say I want to downgrade to CUDA 11.7 in its own conda environment. First, I will create a new environment named cuda11-7 with the following command:\nmamba create -n cuda11-7 python=3.8\nmamba activate cuda11-7\nBefore I downgrade, we can check our CUDA version with the following command:\n&gt; nvcc --version\n\nnvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver\nCopyright (c) 2005-2022 NVIDIA Corporation\nBuilt on Wed_Sep_21_10:33:58_PDT_2022\nCuda compilation tools, release 11.8, V11.8.89\nBuild cuda_11.8.r11.8/compiler.31833905_0\nAs you can see, I have CUDA version 11.8 but I want to downgrade to 11.7. We can downgrade CUDA by using cuda-toolkit:\nmamba install -c \"nvidia/label/cuda-11.7.1\" cuda-toolkit\nThis will take several minutes to complete. Next, recheck your CUDA version:\n&gt; nvcc --version\n\nnvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver\nCopyright (c) 2005-2022 NVIDIA Corporation\nBuilt on Wed_Jun__8_16:49:14_PDT_2022\nCuda compilation tools, release 11.7, V11.7.99\nBuild cuda_11.7.r11.7/compiler.31442593_0\nNext, you need to install the correct version of PyTorch for your CUDA version. It is crucial to install the right version of PyTorch that matches your CUDA version exactly. For example, if you want to install PyTorch with CUDA 11.7, you can use the following command:\nmamba install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia\nYou can find PyTorch installation instructions on this page.\nViola! You have downgraded your CUDA version successfully. Note that this version of CUDA is isolated to this specific environment.\nTo make sure that everything is working correctly, make sure you can import torch and check the CUDA version from within Python:\n&gt; python -c \"import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)\"\n11.7"
